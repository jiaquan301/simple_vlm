### üìã Contribution Guidelines

#### Before You Start
1. **Check existing issues** to see if your idea is already being discussed
2. **Open an issue** to discuss major changes before implementing
3. **Read the code** to understand the current architecture and style
4. **Test your environment** by running the existing code successfully

#### Code Standards

**Code Style:**
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use descriptive variable names that explain the concept
- Add comprehensive comments explaining the "why" not just the "what"
- Keep functions focused and modular

**Documentation:**
- Every new function should have a clear docstring
- Complex algorithms should have step-by-step comments
- Include examples in docstrings when helpful
- Update README.md if you add new features

**Educational Focus:**
- Prioritize clarity over optimization
- Explain trade-offs and design decisions
- Use meaningful variable names that reflect ML concepts
- Add print statements to show intermediate results

#### Example Code Style

```python
class CrossModalAttention(nn.Module):
    """
    Cross-modal attention mechanism that allows text tokens to attend to image patches.
    
    This is the core innovation that enables VLMs to understand relationships
    between visual and textual information. When generating text, each word
    can "look at" relevant parts of the image.
    
    Args:
        d_model: Hidden dimension size
        n_heads: Number of parallel attention heads
    """
    
    def __init__(self, d_model, n_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.n_heads = n_heads
        
        # Text features become queries: "What visual info do I need?"
        self.q_linear = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        
        # Image features become keys/values: "What visual info can I provide?"
        self.k_linear = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.v_linear = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
    
    def forward(self, text_features, image_features):
        """
        Compute cross-modal attention between text and image features.
        
        The intuition: when generating the word "red", we want the model
        to pay attention to red regions in the image.
        """
        # Implementation details with educational comments...
```

### üîÑ Development Process

#### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-vlm.git
   cd simple-vlm
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash

   ```
4. **Test the installation**:
   ```bash
   python simple_vlm.py
   python minimal_vlm.py
   ```

#### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above
3. **Test thoroughly**:
   ```bash
   # Test that existing functionality still works
   python simple_vlm.py
   python minimal_vlm.py
   
   # Test your new features
   python your_new_script.py

### üß™ Testing Guidelines

#### Manual Testing
- Run all existing scripts to ensure they still work
- Test your new features with different inputs
- Verify that educational explanations are accurate
- Check that code runs on different Python versions (3.8+)

#### Educational Testing
- Ask yourself: "Would a beginner understand this?"
- Test explanations with someone unfamiliar with the code
- Ensure examples are self-contained and runnable
- Verify that comments accurately describe the code behavior

### üìù Documentation Standards

#### Code Comments
```python
# Good: Explains the concept and intuition
# Cross-modal attention: Let text "ask questions" of the image
attention_scores = torch.matmul(text_queries, image_keys.transpose(-2, -1))

# Bad: Just restates the code
# Multiply text_queries with transposed image_keys
attention_scores = torch.matmul(text_queries, image_keys.transpose(-2, -1))
```

#### README Updates
