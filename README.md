A minimal implementation of Vision Language Model (VLM) built from scratch in PyTorch, extending Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities with visual understanding. This educational project demonstrates the core concepts behind modern multimodal AI systems like GPT-4V, CLIP, and Flamingo.

## 🎯 Purpose

This implementation serves as an educational tool to understand how Vision Language Models work at a fundamental level. By building VLM from the ground up, extending our previous LLM implementation, you'll gain deep insights into:

- How visual and textual information can be unified in a single model
- The mechanics of cross-modal attention mechanisms
- The architecture design principles behind modern multimodal AI
- The training strategies for vision-language tasks

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Our VLM extends the LLM architecture with visual processing capabilities:

```
Input Image (224×224) → Vision Encoder → Image Features (196×64)
                                              ↓
Input Text → Text Embedding → VLM Transformer Blocks → Output Logits
                                    ↑
                            Cross-Modal Attention
```

### Core Components

#### 1. Vision Encoder
- **Patch-based processing**: Divides images into 16×16 patches
- **Vision Transformer**: Processes patch sequences with self-attention
- **Spatial encoding**: Maintains spatial relationships between patches

#### 2. Cross-Modal Attention
- **Query from text**: Text tokens query relevant visual information
- **Key/Value from image**: Image patches provide visual context
- **Dynamic attention**: Attention weights adapt based on text content

#### 3. VLM Transformer Blocks
- **Self-attention**: Processes text sequence internally
- **Cross-attention**: Integrates visual information into text processing
- **Feed-forward**: Non-linear transformations for feature refinement

## 🔍 Implementation Details

### Vision Encoder Design

```python
class SimpleVisionEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, image_size=224, patch_size=16, d_model=128):
        # Patch embedding: Convert image patches to feature vectors
        self.patch_embedding = nn.Linear(patch_dim, d_model)
        
        # Position embedding: Add spatial information
        self.position_embedding = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1, n_patches, d_model))
        
        # Transformer layers: Process patch sequences
        self.transformer_layers = nn.ModuleList([...])
```

**Key Features:**
- Converts 224×224 images into 196 patch tokens (14×14 grid)
- Each patch becomes a 64-dimensional feature vector
- Preserves spatial relationships through position embeddings

### Cross-Modal Attention Mechanism

```python
class CrossModalAttention(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, text_features, image_features):
        # Text queries what information it needs
        Q = self.q_linear(text_features)
        
        # Image provides keys and values
        K = self.k_linear(image_features)
        V = self.v_linear(image_features)
        
        # Compute attention: which image regions are relevant?
        scores = torch.matmul(Q, K.transpose(-2, -1))
        attention_weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
        
        # Weighted combination of image features
        return torch.matmul(attention_weights, V)
```

**How it works:**
- When generating "red", attention focuses on red regions
- When generating "square", attention focuses on shape boundaries
- Dynamic attention enables fine-grained vision-language correspondence

## 📊 Training Process

# Simple training data for demonstration
text = """
